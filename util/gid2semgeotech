/*This program converts the Binary (provided that ncdump command exists)
or ASCII exodus file exported from the CUBIT to several mesh files required
by the SPECFEM3D_GEOTECH package. Basic steps starting from the CUBIT:
in CUBIT:
- blocks defines only the material regions
  -> actual material properties should not be defined within the CUBIT.
  actual material properties can be listed later corresponding to each block
  (i.e., material region).
- nodal boundary conditions must be defined using node set
  -> each node set name must contain the corresponding BC names as defined in
  char *ns_bcname[] below
  e.g., node set name can be front_nsbcux or front_nsbcux_nsbcuy etc.
- surface boundary conditions must be defined using side set
  -> each side set name must contain the corresponding BC names as defined in
  char *ss_bcname[] below
  e.g., side set name can be front_ssbcux or front_ssbcux_ssbcuy etc.

step1: export mesh file as exodus file say "mesh.e"
step2: convert "mesh.e" to ASCII file using
  >>ncdump mesh.e > mesh.txt
step3: produce mesh and BC files
  >>exodus2sem mesh.txt
  OR
  >>exodus2sem mesh.txt 1000.0

There will be several output files:
*_coord_? : total number of nodes followed by nodal coordinate ? (? -> x, y, z)
*_connectivity : total number of elements followed by connectivity list
*_material_id : total number of elements followed by material IDs
*_??bcu? : node IDs which have u? = 0 as the boundary conditions (?? -> ns or ss, ? -> x, y, z)

DEPENDENCY:
  stringmanip.c: string manipulation routines
COMPILE:
  gcc exodus2sem.c -o exodus2sem
USAGE:
  exodus2sem <inputfile> <OPTIONS>
  Example: exodus2sem sloep3d_mest.txt
  or
  exodus2sem slope3d_mesh.e -fac=0.001 -bin=1
OPTIONS:
  -fac: use this option to multiply coordinates. this is importantn for unit
        conversion, e.g., to convert m to km use -fac=0.001
  -bin: use this option if you want to convert exodus binary directly, provided
        that the command ncdump is in the path. ncdump is a part of netCDF library
        that can be downloaded freely from
        http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp. use -bin=1 for binary
        or -bin=0 for ascii file.
